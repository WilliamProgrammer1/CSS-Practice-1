    <p>This is text that flows around the image on the left. That image should be against the side of the page. It is on the right side of the page and it is very good text that is next to the image. I a writing text to have a bigger paragraph to show that it is staying to the right of the image of the photo of HTML.</p>

    <p class="clear">This should be a paragraph here that is always spatially after and beneath the image above, and above the image below. It is going to stay in the middle and it is always after the beneath the image above. I am trying to type as much as I can to make more words and take up more space so I can scroll down so I can effectively use the "To the top" link to take me to the top of this amazing website with lots of great text and some good photos along with it. It also has a very good list, where when you hover, the color of the little bar on the left changes which is pretty cool.</p>

    <p>This text should flow around the image to the right. That image should be against the right of the page. This text is going to flow around the image which is very cool because we can see the words of this text box. There is a very nice photo of HTML logo and it looks very good with its white and orange colors.</p>
